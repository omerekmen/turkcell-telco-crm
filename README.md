# Telco CRM Platform

An event-driven microservices platform that manages the full subscriber lifecycle for a GSM
operator (the fictional operator "TelcoX"): customer registration and KYC, product and tariff
catalog, ordering, subscription activation, usage and quota tracking, billing, payment,
notification, and customer support ticketing.

The platform is built around a custom CQRS + Mediator framework, a transactional outbox/inbox
for reliable eventing, and a governed hybrid application architecture. It is documented through
Architecture Decision Records, which are the single source of technical truth.

Key principles (see ADRs for the authoritative rules):

- Each service owns its PostgreSQL schema; no cross-service database access (ADR-006).
- External APIs use `/api/v1` and return `ApiResult<T>` with trace metadata (ADR-015).
- Internal calls prefer gRPC; events are versioned Avro on Kafka (ADR-005, ADR-009, ADR-019).
- A DB write plus an event publish is atomic via the outbox; consumers deduplicate via the inbox (ADR-005).
- Services depend only on platform starters, never on platform-core directly (ADR-018, ADR-020).

## Platform Modules

The platform follows a layered Maven architecture (ADR-020). Microservices depend only on
starters; starters wrap framework-agnostic core modules with Spring auto-configuration.

```text
platform-bom  ->  platform-core/*  ->  platform-starters/*  ->  microservices
```

| Layer | Modules | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BOM | `platform-bom` | Centralized dependency and version management |
| Core (no Spring) | `platform-common`, `platform-cqrs`, `platform-mediator`, `platform-outbox`, `platform-inbox` | Framework-agnostic primitives and ports |
| Event contracts | `platform-event-contracts` | Avro schemas and versioned event definitions |
| Starters (Spring) | `starter-api`, `starter-mediator`, `starter-security`, `starter-outbox`, `starter-inbox`, `starter-observability` | Auto-configuration, adapters, configuration properties |

Rule: business logic is forbidden in platform modules; core modules carry no Spring dependency
(ADR-007, ADR-018, ADR-020).

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Java 21, Maven, Docker.

```bash
# Build the platform (Maven reactor root is platform/)
cd platform
mvn -B -ntp clean install

# A microservice then consumes platform capabilities via starters, for example:
#   <dependency>
#     <groupId>com.telco.platform</groupId>
#     <artifactId>starter-mediator</artifactId>
#   </dependency>
```

Local infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, observability) is provided via Docker Compose
as services are added. See the roadmap for delivery sequencing.

P3 revenue cycle, P4 engagement and support, P5 hardening and release. See
[docs/product/roadmap.md](docs/product/roadmap.md) and the execution detail in

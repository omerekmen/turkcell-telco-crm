/**
 * Domain service evaluating campaign eligibility and enforcing redemption caps
 * (design-note.md Section 5, ADR-027 Decision Section 4, Features 21.2.2/21.2.3).
 *
 * <p>Not invoked through the {@code Mediator} (this is a plain domain service, not a command/query
 * handler) - 21.3's validate endpoint and 21.4's event consumers call it directly. Both public methods
 * are self-transactional ({@code @Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)}) rather than relying on
 * the mediator's {@code TransactionBehavior}, since neither caller guarantees a surrounding
 * mediator-dispatched transaction - and, when a caller (such as
 * {@code CreateRedemptionReservationCommandHandler}) IS itself a {@code Command} already wrapped in a
 * {@code TransactionBehavior} transaction, plain {@code REQUIRED} propagation would join that outer
 * transaction rather than run independently: a caught-and-swallowed {@link BusinessRuleException}
 * would still leave the outer transaction marked rollback-only, failing the handler's own commit with
 * {@code UnexpectedRollbackException} even though the exception was handled. {@code REQUIRES_NEW}
 * guarantees a genuinely independent transaction regardless of caller context, so a caller that
 * deliberately catches and swallows one of this class's exceptions (as
 * {@code CreateRedemptionReservationCommandHandler} does for the cap-exceeded race) can still commit
 * its own transaction normally.
 *
 * <p>{@link #evaluate} is deliberately a pure read except for the defensive auto-expire side effect
 * (ADR-027: "Redemption is not counted at the synchronous validation call ... it is a pure read").
 * {@link #reserve} is the concurrency-safe write path that actually consumes a cap slot; it locks the
 * {@link Campaign} row ({@code PESSIMISTIC_WRITE}) for the duration of the count-then-write decision so
 * two concurrent reservation attempts against the same campaign cannot both observe a slot as free.

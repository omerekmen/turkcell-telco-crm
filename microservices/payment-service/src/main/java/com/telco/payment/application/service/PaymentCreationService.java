 * transaction: if the PSP call fails with the circuit breaker OPEN, the outer
 * {@code TransactionBehavior} rolls back its transaction, but the PENDING payment
 * row has already been committed here and is visible to the retry scheduler.
 *
 * <p>REQUIRES_NEW requires a Spring-managed proxy call (cannot be called as {@code this.method()}
 * from the same class), so this lives in a separate bean.

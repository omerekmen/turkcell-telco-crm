/**
 * Initiates a PSP charge for an order.
 *
 * <p>Two complementary idempotency layers protect this command, each guarding a different failure:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Inbox dedup ({@code idempotencyKey})</b> - guards against duplicate Kafka <em>deliveries</em>
 *       of the SAME {@code order.created.v1} message. The {@link com.telco.platform.inbox.InboxBehavior}
 *       inserts the inbox row INSIDE the handler transaction (ADR-005 exactly-once-effect): the inbox
 *       row, the payment write and the outbox event commit or roll back together. The key is the Kafka
 *       record key (the outbox event id set by the relay) on the saga path. On the REST/admin path the
 *       caller supplies its own stable {@code idempotencyKey} (the {@code paymentRequestId}), so the
 *       inbox guard is a harmless per-request no-op rather than a null-key insert.</li>
 *   <li><b>Command-level dedup ({@code paymentRequestId})</b> - guards against the SAME order being
 *       charged twice through DIFFERENT messages (e.g. a fresh inbox key after a compaction or a manual
 *       admin replay). The handler looks the payment up by {@code paymentRequestId} (derived from
 *       {@code orderId}) and returns the existing payment for a terminal state instead of re-charging
 *       (FR-25, FR-26).</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both layers stay active and are independent: the inbox protects the delivery, the
 * {@code paymentRequestId} protects the business effect.

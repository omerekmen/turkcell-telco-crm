// Theme resolution for the light/dark switch.

// Pure and framework-agnostic (unit tested in Node), because the same three rules
// are applied from two very different places: the blocking inline script in
// app.html (which must decide the theme BEFORE first paint, to avoid a flash of
// the wrong theme) and the reactive store the toggle drives. Keeping the rules
// here means those two can never disagree.
//
// There is no tri-state "system" mode: an untouched install renders DARK (the
// product's default look), and the first explicit toggle becomes a persisted
// choice. The OS preference is no longer consulted for the initial render.

# Telco CRM Platform Documentation

This directory holds the product and architecture documentation for the Telco CRM Platform.
Architecture Decision Records (the technical authority) live in
[`/architecture/adr/`](../architecture/adr/). Execution planning and live status live in
[`tasks/`](./tasks/) and [`tasks/STATUS.md`](./tasks/STATUS.md).

Authority rule: where business documents and ADRs disagree on technical decisions, the
ADRs are authoritative (`CLAUDE.md` Section 3).

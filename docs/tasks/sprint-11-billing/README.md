# Sprint 11 - Billing

## Objective

Build billing-service (9007): a monthly bill-run that generates invoices for all active postpaid
subscribers, composes invoice lines (monthly fee, addons, overage, VAS, taxes), renders PDFs, emits
invoice events, and reconciles payment. Delivers acceptance criterion AC-02 and the bill-run
performance target (NFR-02).

Covers FR-21, FR-22, FR-23, FR-24.

## Included Epics

- Epic 11: Billing (billing-service)

| 11.5 | Read API | [11.5-read-api.md](11.5-read-api.md) |

## Sprint Deliverables

- billing-service (9007): event-fed read models, invoice line composition, idempotent monthly
  bill-run with manual trigger, PDF rendering/storage, payment reconciliation, overdue detection,
  invoice read APIs, and integration tests.
- AC-02 integration test.

## Exit Criteria

- AC-02 passes: a bill-run aggregates last-period usage per subscriber, generates a PDF invoice,
  emits `invoice.generated.v1` (notification consumes it in Sprint 12), and on payment emits
  `invoice.paid.v1`.
- The bill-run is idempotent per (subscriber, period) and meets the NFR-02 throughput target in a
  load test.
- FR-21, FR-22, FR-23, FR-24 pass.

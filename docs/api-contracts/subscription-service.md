# subscription-service - API Contract

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | 9005 |
| Mode | CQRS + Mediator |
| Base path | `/api/v1` |
| Owning sprint | [Sprint 09](../tasks/sprint-09-subscription-and-onboarding-saga/README.md) |
| Build status | TODO |
| Requirements | FR-13, FR-14, FR-15 (FR-16 MNP post-MVP) |

Bounded context: subscription lifecycle state machine and atomic MSISDN allocation/release.
Audit mandatory.

## Authentication and Authorization

Read and lifecycle endpoints require a valid JWT. Activation is internal (saga-driven).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Idempotency | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/subscriptions` | Internal (saga) | mandatory | Activate a subscription; allocate MSISDN. |
| GET | `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | JWT | - | Fetch a subscription. |
| GET | `/api/v1/subscriptions` | JWT | - | List a customer's subscriptions (paged). |
| POST | `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/suspend` | JWT | - | Suspend (e.g. non-payment). |
| POST | `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/reactivate` | JWT | - | Reactivate a suspended subscription. |
| POST | `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/terminate` | JWT | - | Terminate; release MSISDN. |

## Events

| Direction | Event |
| --- | --- |
| Publish | `subscription.activated.v1`, `subscription.suspended.v1`, `subscription.terminated.v1`, `subscription.activation-failed.v1`, `subscription.tariff-changed.v1`, `msisdn.allocated.v1`, `msisdn.released.v1` |
| Consume | `payment.completed.v1` (activation / plan-change trigger), `payment.failed.v1` (after grace period) |

### payment.completed.v1 branching (Sprint 24 Features 24.3/24.4, design-note D1/D2)

The consumer fetches the order (`GET /internal/orders/{id}`) and branches on its persisted
`orderType`:

- `NEW_LINE` - activate a new subscription (unchanged pre-24 behavior; the one-tariff-line
  invariant counts `TARIFF` items only, so bundled `ADDON` items are allowed).
- `PLAN_CHANGE` - `ChangeTariffCommand` against the single tariff item's `targetSubscriptionId`:
  re-validates existence, ownership and ACTIVE status, applies the order's pinned tariff
  snapshot, and publishes `subscription.tariff-changed.v1` (keyed by subscriptionId). A terminal
  failure (subscription gone / not owned / not ACTIVE / same tariff) REUSES
  `subscription.activation-failed.v1` - a documented event-name reuse (design-note D2) - so the
  existing refund/cancel compensation runs with zero new consumers.
- `ADDON` - ignored entirely: standalone addon orders have no activation leg; order-service owns
  their fulfillment and publishes `addon.purchased.v1` itself.

`subscription.tariff-changed.v1` rides `subscription.events` as its third event type: consumers
MUST filter on the `eventType` header and use per-listener consumer groups, and MUST dedup on the
event's `orderId` (the record key is the subscriptionId - NOT unique across successive plan
changes of the same subscription).

## Notes

- MSISDN allocation is atomic and concurrency-safe; no MSISDN is double-allocated.
- Lifecycle transitions are enforced as domain invariants; illegal transitions are rejected.
- Subscription list pagination: `page` (default 0), `size` (default 20) and optional
  `sort=field,asc|desc` (direction optional, `desc` assumed; default `createdAt,desc`). Sortable
  fields: `createdAt`, `activatedAt`, `status`. Any other field or a malformed value returns the
  standard 400 validation error shape.

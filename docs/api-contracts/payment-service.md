All endpoints require a valid JWT. Refund requires an operations role.

## Endpoints

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/payments` | JWT | **mandatory** | Charge via mock PSP; idempotent by key. |
| GET | `/api/v1/payments/{id}` | JWT | - | Fetch a payment and its attempts. |

## Notes

- `Idempotency-Key` mandatory on charge and refund; duplicate keys return the original outcome.
- Failed payments retry on a 24/72/168h schedule before final failure.
- Audit rows written for every charge/refund state change.

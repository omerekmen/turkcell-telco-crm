-- Schema-level grants for Debezium CDC read access (ADR-009, ADR-019).
-- Grants SELECT on all FUTURE tables created by each service user in the public schema
-- via ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. Runs as POSTGRES_USER (superuser) via \c metacommand,
-- which Docker's PostgreSQL entrypoint supports in initdb .sql files.
--
-- Service users own their databases (and therefore the public schema in PG15+),
-- so no extra schema grants are needed for Flyway to run DDL.
-- reference_db is excluded — reference-service publishes no domain events.
